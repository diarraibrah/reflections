What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	> Initializing a repository creates a .git folder within the repository. This is required in order for git  	to track changes.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	> Items in the staging area and repository are tracked, the ones in the working directory are not.
	> I creates a restore point if needed.
