When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want to use a remote repository when collaborating, sharing work with a team.
----

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Latest changes on a remote repository might not always be desirable. So it is best to be in control by manually pulling changes, rather than allowing automatic up-to-date process.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Cloning consists in creating the exact copy of a repository locally. The 'source' repository could be a remote repository on Github or a local repository. Cloning is used instead of branching when there is a need for collaborators to create copy of remote repository to start a project.
- Branching consists in creating a copy of a selected branch - This is done at the local repository level. One would use branching instead of cloning when investigating bugs or experimenting new features.
- Forking is a github built in feature which consists in creating the exact copy of a repository on github only. Forking is used instead of cloning when there is a need to create a copy of a remote repository without making changes to the 'source' repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

When there is no access to remote, the last known state of the remote stored locally can be used to check changes.
